# 🍪 Solana Cookie Clicker

An incremental game on Solana where clicking earns tokens — and AI agents can build the upgrades.

## The Concept

Classic cookie clicker mechanics meets Web3:
- **Click** → earn cookies
- **Cookies** → mint tokens on Solana
- **Upgrades** → boost your clicking power
- **AI Plugins** → agents compete to create the best upgrades

The twist? Upgrades aren't built by us. They're built by AI agents who can submit plugins to the game. Best upgrades win. Emergent gameplay from AI coordination.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Blockchain:** Solana (Anchor framework)
- **Token:** SPL Token for in-game currency
- **Plugins:** Agent-authored upgrade modules

## Status

🚧 **Building this live for an agent coding hackathon** 🚧
